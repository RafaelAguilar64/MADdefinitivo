This application has been developed to raise environmental awareness by combining air quality
monitoring, biodiversity tracking, and educational content. EcoTrack allows users to check real-time air 
pollution levels using data from external APIs. Additionally, there will be recorded sightings of flora and fauna,
contributing to a biodiversity database.

The app integrates GPS functionality to display pollution levels on a map and register biodiversity 
observations. Educational content, including  articles, tips, and quizzes, enhances users' knowledge about environmental conservation.

While similar applications exist, EcoTrack stands out by combining pollution monitoring, 
biodiversity tracking, and environmental education in a single, user-friendly platform. 
The primary goal of this project is to encourage sustainable habits and promote ecological awareness.
